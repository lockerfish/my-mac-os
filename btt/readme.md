# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)

I use BTT to [customize different trackpad gestures](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze) either globally or on per app basis. I also use BTT for all my window management needs (move window left/right or maximize).

You can download my [BTT Profile](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os@master/btt/Main.bttpreset) and import it to your BetterTouchTool to get all gestures I setup for myself (or just look around and see what you like). Gestures that save me most time are moving between tabs with three finger gestures (+ closing/opening tabs with up & down gestures).

I also use BTT to modify my TouchBar. Here is how it looks:

It shows, from left to right:

1. All day event (if there is any).
2. Current or next event in [my Calendar](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/fantastical)
3. Current time, day and month number
4. Battery percentage

Can easily tell that it's an all day event as it won't have time stamps shown below the event title.
